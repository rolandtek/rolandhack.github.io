I’m **ADANDE Tobi Roland**, also known as **Roland Hack**.
 Passionate about cybersecurity, I study at Epitech Bénin and enjoy bug bounty hunting in my free time. My main focus is web and mobile hacking, and I’m always looking for new challenges in this field.
I also occasionally participate in CTFs.
